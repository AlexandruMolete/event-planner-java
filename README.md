# event-planner-java
Event planner using Maven, Java, Swing and MySQL.
I realized multiple graphical frames and dialog panels using Java Swing;
I built SQL tables in MySQL and mapped them into Java classes;
I defined One-To-One, One-To-Many and Many-To-Many relations between tables;
I made CRUD operations for every table;
I used Model View Controller as an architectural design pattern;
In order to write the code clean, I have made sure to respect the SOLID principles, use suggestive identifiers and short methods, avoid using the null value as much as possible and avoid duplicating the code;
I applied other design patterns, such as: Singleton, Builder and Observer, where is necessary;
Finally, to create event notifications, I used concurrent elements, such as: executors, synchronized objects and concurrent collections.
